# quantum-classification

The dataset contains well log data of a single well. The well logs help identify the lithology of the rocks in the subsurface. Geological intrerpretation gives lables to every 0.5 ft layer in the subsurface. Supervised classifiers have been used to predict lithology based on well logs values. In this project, I compare a classical model (SVC) to a quantum model (QSVC) to see if a quantum space helps improve the accuracy.
